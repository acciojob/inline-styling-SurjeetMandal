		<p>The common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is a species of large annual forb of the genus Helianthus. It is commonly grown as a crop for its edible oily seeds. Apart from cooking oil production, it is also used as livestock forage (as a meal or a silage plant), as bird food, in some industrial applications, and as an ornamental in domestic gardens.</p>

		<p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[2] in the family Rosaceae (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[2] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[3] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.[3] Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.</p>
